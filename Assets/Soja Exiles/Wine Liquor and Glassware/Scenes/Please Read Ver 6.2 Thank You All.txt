Thank you very much for purchasing or updating the new Wine Liquor Beer Glassware and Modular Bar Build Kit

Ver 6.2  is huge!

I cannot show you my appreciation enough.  To all the users, thank you for all your support.

I hope you enjoy using these assets as much as I enjoyed producing them.  

This Build kit was the final of my initial plan, ever since creating the first build kit of  the Coffee or Tea Build Kit, I am happy to say that I can now move on to the next big project.

The Build Kit is made based off a grid system X, Z, Y  Walls & Floors of 2.5 X 2.5 X 4, you can use Unity’s progrids to assist building.

The Interior walls sit on top of the interor floors in order to have a nice seamless fit.

A number of brand new textures, brand new and revised materials, optimized models and a vast amount of brand new models and artwork have been added.

Ver 6 has a total of 6 brand new scenes, the old scene and version has been archived within the folder if anyone wishes to go back to them.

If you already own the package or are purchasing it brand new, I would greatly appreciate it if you could take a minute to rate and review my package, your feedback encourages me to create new and bigger packages.
